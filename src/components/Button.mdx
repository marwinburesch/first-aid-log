# Button Component

The Button component will be mainly used on the landing page. The icon is just a placeholder at the moment, calm down. This should be dynamically changeable, to switch between available icons and whatnot.

<Props of={Button} />

## Basic Usage

<Playground>
  <Button fill="#EC3D2A" firstRosponse="tel:01234567890" />
</Playground>

# Logo Component

The Logo component is just a placeholder at the moment, calm down.

<Props of={Logo} />

## Basic Usage

Height and width can be adjusted by setting the `height` and `width` properties. Color can be chosen by setting the `fill` property.

- sizes should be consolidated and dynamisized at a later stage.

<Playground>
  <Logo height="50px" width="50px" fill="#EC3D2A" />
</Playground>
